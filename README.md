# Full Stack Web Developer

Hello, I am a full stack web developer with experience in building and maintaining web applications. I have a strong understanding of front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I am also proficient in using Git for version control and have experience with web development frameworks such as React .

I am always eager to learn new technologies and enjoy solving complex problems. In my free time, I like to experiment with new web development tools and techniques.
